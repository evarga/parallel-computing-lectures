# Introduction
Material for lectures related to topics in parallel and distributed computing as described in the book [Topics in Parallel and Distributed Computing: Introducing Concurrency in Undergraduate Courses](https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/?q=cedr_book). Each lecture corresponds to one (or sometimes two) chapter(s) from the book. Examples are augmented with additional subtasks that are documented as code comments. All accompanying code is tested and contains extensions and fixes compared to the version published in the book. There are also programs not mentioned in the book.

> Every lecture usually encompasses multiple hours of teaching material.

# Structure
Inside each lecture folder there is a PowerPoint presentation named as `presentation-<lecture number>` (for example, `presentation-1.pptx`). This is purely a driver for source code, which is the primary medium to convey concepts regarding parallel and distributed computing.
